# OIB Task 3

Hello connections,

I am excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 3 as a Web Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte of the October 2022 batch. In this task, I created a Temperature Converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Details

- Task: Temperature Converter Website
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the temperature converter website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that applies styling to the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and functionality to the temperature converter.

3. Use the input field to enter the temperature value in one unit (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit).

4. Select the desired conversion option (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).

5. Click the "Convert" button to calculate and display the converted temperature in the other unit.

6. The converted temperature will be shown in the result area of the website.
