# OIB Task 2

Hello connections,

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed Task 2 as a Web Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte of the October 2022 batch. In this task, I created a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Details

- Task: Portfolio
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the portfolio website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that applies styling to the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and functionality to the portfolio

## Preview

To preview the portfolio website, you can visit the following link: [Portfolio Website Preview](https://github.com/priyaan27/OIB_WebDevelopment_Internship/tree/main/oibsip_task2)

## Usage

To use the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jithendra-varma/OIB_WebDevelopment_Internship.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the portfolio website layout and the applied CSS styles.

3. Modify the HTML file (`index.html`) to add or edit the content of your portfolio, including your projects, skills, experience, and contact information.

4. Adjust the CSS rules in the `styles.css` file to customize the visual appearance according to your preferences.

5. If you want to add additional functionality or interactivity, you can modify the `script.js` file accordingly.
